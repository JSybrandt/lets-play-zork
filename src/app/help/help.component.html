<h3>Useful commands:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The 'BRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions for rooms which have been visited.  The 'SUPERBRIEF' command suppresses printing of long room descriptions for all rooms.  The 'VERBOSE' command restores long descriptions.</li>
  <li>The 'INFO' command prints information which might give some idea of what the game is about.</li>
  <li>The 'QUIT' command prints your score and asks whether you wish to continue playing.</li>
  <li>The 'SAVE' command saves the state of the game for later continuation.</li>
  <li>The 'RESTORE' command restores a saved game.</li>
  <li>The 'INVENTORY' command lists the objects in your possession.</li>

</ul>

<h3> Command abbreviations:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The 'INVENTORY' command may be abbreviated 'I'.</li>
  <li>The 'LOOK' command may be abbreviated 'L'.</li>
  <li>The 'QUIT' command may be abbreviated 'Q'.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Containment:</h3>

<p>
  Some objects can contain other objects. Many such containers can be opened
  and closed.The rest are always open. They may or may not be transparent.  For
  you to access (e.g., take) an object which is in a container, the container
  must be open. For you to see such an object, the container must be either
  open or transparent. Containers have a capacity, and objects have sizes; the
  number of objects which will fit therefore depends on their sizes.  You may
  put any object you have access to (it need not be in your hands) into any
  other object.  At some point, the program will attempt to pick it up if you
  don't already have it, which process may fail if you're carrying too much.
  Although containers can contain other containers, the program doesn't access
  more than one level down.

<h3>Fighting:</h3>

<p>
   Occupants of the dungeon will, as a rule, fight back when attacked.  In some
   cases, they may attack even if unprovoked.  Useful verbs here are 'ATTACK
   &ltvillain&gt WITH &ltweapon&gt', 'KILL', etc.  Knife-throwing may or may not be
   useful.  You have a fighting strength which varies with time.  Being in a
   fight, getting killed, and being injured all lower this strength.  Strength
   is regained with time.  Thus, it is not a good idea to fight someone
   immediately after being killed.  Other details should become apparent after
   a few melees or deaths.
</p>

<h3>Command parser:</h3>

<p>
   A command is one line of text terminated by a carriage return.  For reasons
   of simplicity, all words are distinguished by their first six letters.  All
   others are ignored.  For example, typing 'DISASSEMBLE THE ENCYCLOPEDIA' is
   not only meaningless, it also creates excess effort for your fingers.  Note
   that this truncation may produce ambiguities in the interpretation of longer
   words.
</p>

<p>
   You are dealing with a fairly stupid parser, which understands the following
   types of things--
</p>

<ul>
  <li><p><b>Actions:</b>
    Among the more obvious of these, such as TAKE, PUT, DROP, etc.  Fairly
    general forms of these may be used, such as PICK UP, PUT DOWN,
    etc.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Directions:</b>
    NORTH, SOUTH, UP, DOWN, etc. and their various abbreviations.  Other more
    obscure directions (LAND, CROSS) are appropriate in only certain
    situations.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Objects:</b>
    Most objects have names and can be referenced by them.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Adjectives:</b>
    Some adjectives are understood and required when there are two objects
    which can be referenced with the same 'name' (e.g., DOORs,
    BUTTONs).</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Prepositions:</b>
    It may be necessary in some cases to include prepositions, but the parser
    attempts to handle cases which aren't ambiguous without.  Thus 'GIVE CAR TO
    DEMON' will work, as will 'GIVE DEMON CAR'.  'GIVE CAR DEMON' probably
    won't do anything interesting.  When a preposition is used, it should be
    appropriate;  'GIVE CAR WITH DEMON' won't parse.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Sentences:</b>
    The parser understands a reasonable number of syntactic construc- tions.
    In particular, multiple commands (separated by commas) can be placed on the
    same line.</p></li>
  <li><p><b>Ambiguity:</b>
    The parser tries to be clever about what to do in the case of actions which
    require objects that are not explicitly specified.  If there is only one
    possible object, the parser will assume that it should be used.  Otherwise,
    the parser will ask.  Most questions asked by the parser can be
    answered.</p></li>
</ul>
